2024-12-01,Birdland,5.7+,"Last day w/ Susan and link. Great climb. Led P4. Would love to return and led them all. P2 was little complicated. Take your time and find good holds, jams, and feet (behind you). P3 was spooky and delicate but would lead. Take time on traverse. Link built trad anchor top P5, so Susan and I got a free mini lead pitch on the crux moves to get to the rap rings.

Jack linked P5-7 required with 70 and 5m of simuling. P1 was awesome, runout was fine. Absurd beta from me on p3. RH ring lock, LH sloper, RF foot jam, LF smear. I definitely don’t over climb 5.6.

2024-11-29,Dark Shadows,5.8,"W/ Jack and Susan. We crushed. Led P1. 
P1 was slabby, felt sketch. 
Jack led p2-4, p2 5.6 but awkward, slick, and committing; would lead but would be stressful. P3, fell off lay back 10-15&#34; up forward. Was spooky because it was a true fall. But bad beta, need to find handjams deep in the crack and use feet inside crack instead of layback. Rest of climbing was sweet. P4 off width was fine but would be scary lead. Use small holds inside crack and reach high. 2 raps with twins. Maybe full thing, next trip?",https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105732380/dark-shadows,4,Nevada > Southern Nevada > Red Rocks > (10) Pine Creek Canyon > Mescalito > Dark Shadows Wall,3.6,4,Lead,,Trad,,350.0,2100
2024-11-28,Olive Oil,5.7,"W/ Tom behind Susan and Jack. Led P1/3/5
P1 a bit sketch but manageable, forgot the nuts wish I had them. Committing move out left. Apparently placed a .3 as a nut and then forgot to clip it or it unclipped itself?? P3 chill, P5 traverse used good holds as feet and worked over. Scary ass chimney. Had to hang bag, and Jack left a 3 for me which helped, still one of the more bold leads I’ve had. Also pulled up rope  too much and almost pulled Tom off the cliff. Descent through gully on right
Anchors: 
P1: 1,2,3
P2: 0.75, 0.5, yellow and blue totem. 4 would have been nice
P3: 0.75, 2, 3

P5: 0.5, 0.4, blue or black totem

2024-11-28,Jungle Wall,5.11b,wE. The bolting felt like they were trying to maximize falls near the cruxes. Very tall route. I don’t recommend doing with a single 70m as it forces you to belay on an exposed pillar. ,https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106052597/jungle-wall,1,Nevada > Southern Nevada > Red Rocks > (11) Juniper Canyon > Jungle Wall,3.8,-1,,,Sport,,160.0,4900

2024-12-01,Birdland,5.7+,"Lead pitches 1,2.  Very fun. Didn't actually place that many nuts on P1. Small gear is useful. Link lead P3, probably the spookiest. The traverse is quite hollow, wouldn't want to place anything there. Might want the roller biner there. Eric led P4, a bit scarcer gear but good climbing. Link lead P5, super chill until the finger crack which was small and slippery. Lots of good 0-0.2 on the right. Crux is at the big sloper that looks like a jug. There is a jam in the back left of that block. Did a single rap to P4 anchor then double rap to P2 then double 70 rap to ground.
