2023-12-15,Interrogation,5.12c/d,"Started working on it today. Third time here, first time just did the tens on the right, second time was too cold and snowy. Today also hiked in the snow and ice to get here but it’s so warm on this wall. Link is projecting the 13c eastern promises, and I’m projecting this one for the winter. They might both be over our heads, many say this is a 13a since holds keep breaking off and it’s sandbagged to start. But… the hard part turned out to be a slab! Anyway the first section leads up to a roof. Moves are doable but physical and then getting over the roof and pulling up on a crimp are all very exhausting for me. After that I love this climb. Very interesting, slabby and vertical moves. A good foot, thinking it might be a pistol squat on the right leg but I can’t really do that and my knees have been hurting a little lately. So next time I want to do the beginning better and find some ideas for that crux slab part. There are some good possibilities a little to the left. But hard since the right foot is way out. I’m excited about this climb!! Even if I don’t lead it cleanly would be awesome to make some progress on this while we’re living in Boulder.

We were all a little tired, but woke up early, said bye to Link’s parents after having breakfast with them in their trailer. And then headed to the trail. Eric and I went ahead and tried to figure out what Link meant by “turn right after 500 yards”. Got a little nervous, tried calling Link, he finally showed up. Hike was sunny and beautiful, got to the base pretty fast. Started climbing, first part was a little tricky because I was using slopers instead of stemming. Eric did it very well. Then we ran into the trash dogs, maybe 2-3 pitches in. They tried passing us but changed their minds, was a little chaotic. But then we continued on ahead. My index finger was split and would’ve started bleeding so I was trying to climb with the other fingers. Next couple pitches were fun, lots of chimneys but you could avoid them, lots of options. Amazing cave after the 4th pitch. Link aka cave yeti led it and then Eric and I had a ton of fun going through it. One of the trash dogs (not litter kitten but the other one whose name I don’t remember was there with us). Then Link was leading to the end but ran out of rope, told us to just start climbing together. Right after we had talked about this scenario the night before at dinner and how it’s not super safe. But anyway it was easy climbing and we got to the top! Ended too fast. Hiked back down and then had beers and chatted with our friends by the van.
