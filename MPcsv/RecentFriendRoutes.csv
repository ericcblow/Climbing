Take your time and find good holds, jams, and feet (behind you). P3 was spooky and delicate but would lead. Take time on traverse.

P1 was slabby, felt sketch. 
Jack led p2-4, p2 5.6 but awkward, slick, and committing; would lead but would be stressful. P3, fell off lay back 10-15&#34; up forward. Was spooky because it was a true fall. But bad beta, need to find handjams deep in the crack and use feet inside crack instead of layback. Rest of climbing was sweet. P4 off width was fine but would be scary lead. Use small holds inside crack and reach high. 2 raps with twins.

P1 a bit sketch but manageable, forgot the nuts wish I had them. Committing move out left. Apparently placed a .3 as a nut and then forgot to clip it or it unclipped itself?? P3 chill, P5 traverse used good holds as feet and worked over. Scary ass chimney. Had to hang bag, and Jack left a 3 for me which helped, still one of the more bold leads I’ve had. Also pulled up rope  too much and almost pulled Tom off the cliff. Descent through gully on right

Very satisfying, then some dihedreal climbing with small R feet into an overhang. Some sections really had little pro and small crack hands, where pulling on a couple fingers was the best you got. Great belay from L who was talking to O on the radio the whole time haha. L lead P23, which had 15 ft of burly climbing on a good hand crack but honestly felt a bit sweaty this day.

Was unnecessary looking back but a really good confidence boost and it was nice to know I wasn&#39;t going to deck. The rest of the climb doesn&#39;t have anything as glassy as that first foot transitioning from R to L flake. I linked P1/2; I took it really slow but it was very enjoyable and challenging. I did not stem the right and left flake but jammed the RF and had the LF on the face. I would have appreciated having my large set of nuts, the anchor at the top of P2 took .5-1 cams. Link lead P34, I think P3 was as challenging as P1 and would have required some effort but P4 was chill and would love to lead that next time. I led P5 and built an anchor on top out of . 4-.75 size.

Oak and I started same time, he tagged the line and I tied in once he made to top, to speed up the process. First three moves of P1 might have been crux, less than ideal finger crack to a jug. Also found the layback crack hard, took at the top. Feet are smears most of the time. Loved P3 traverse with the downclimb to the jug and then the step through. Down climbed to second half on belay but was okay. Linked P4/5 in a really enjoyable dihedral. P6 was rotten band, be careful with choss.

2024-09-01,Jackie,5.5,"With Sara and Lucia. As great of a climb as I remembered. First roof pull was probably crux. Ended up using small RF under the roof to wedge myself inside in order to place gear and rest but didn’t love how small and polished that RF was. Felt great to get through. The roof was also really fun, placed #3 right before then checked out holds before resting and then going for it. One of my best lead trad experiences so far. Sara and Lucia both crushed the pitch and enjoyed the challenge of the roof. Sara expertly deployed some beach whaling techniques that I think she learned from me. We went on for p2 even though the sun was setting and we had one headlamp between the three of us but it’s too nice of a pitch to skip. Got down safe in the dark for Sara’s last climb as a Princetonian. Beta: work fast through an intermediate jug or two on the roof. Large circular horizontal flake at center top of roof is bomber.

Corner was still pretty stressful and but got up it slowly. Traverse felt fun and easy. Sara didn’t like the traverse much because of rope twisting plus exposure. I had to build hanging trad anchor and pitch it out because of rope drag but with one follower. Doing it in one pitch would be doable, more fun, and much more time efficient.

P1 was nice short and nice traversing. P2 had a rock over move which I was a bit nervous for, barely any hands and little to no good gear. I fit a shitty .2 and a nut, not sure either would have held. It’s really a nothing move but felt heady. I got one of the two ropes really stuck in a crack rounding that corner.

Ended up behind a slow but very friendly party. Still love keep hands low on P3 and walking feet. Felt even easier this time and still as much fun. We had some troubles with the double rope rappel with 9.8mm due to Seb and Lucia not weighing enough plus it being their first time. Note: two 70m reached the ground. Solution: tie off one side of the rap with an eight knot and send them down on a single strand. Last person with enough weight and experience unties knots and raps on both.

2024-07-28,Three Pines,5.3,"With Sara. Favorite climb of the day and favorite gunks lead so far. Next time I would combine p1 and p2 but walkies were out of batteries, so we pitched it out to maintain communication. Heart got pumping a bit on the traverse as I struggled to find gear to protect the follow but a .4 then a .3 fit well. P3 is so much fun. Doing this in a triple would be enjoyable and would make the rappel faster. Sara loved it and got a bit higher in the traverse probably because I was keeping her to tight and it was forcing that direction. She should try it again keeping feet low.

2023-11-27,Tunnel Vision,5.7,"Link led tied in middle of 80. Elizabeth and I followed. Perhaps best day/climb of the trip. Absolutely amazing. P1 starts stiff but HJ solves it. Chimney was cool I stayed on outside because it was tight. Works for a follow but would be a problem for a lead. Tunnel pitch was so fun, never climbed anything like it. Simuled gully because 40m rope was a bit short. It was easy climbing for followers and leader at that point so no big deal. Met trash dogs on route. Started late, ~7:30a and in parking lot by 1p.

2023-11-26,Solar Slab,5.6,"Susan Led Mimi and I up P1 and we turned around. Absolutely stunning climb, Susan crushed. Problem is most people do a 30m run out on the slab to put a first piece of gear in the roof crack. We got some help from a party of Canadian simul climbers so didn’t have to place it. I think it’s very doable but when I led it. After reaching the first flake on the slab, I would place pro there. Traverse to the crack place pro there and then down climber to remove the flake pro. We learned there is bolted anchors at each pitch and rappelling each pitch is possible. So next time let’s go for a new high point.

2023-11-26,Solar Slab Gully,5.4,Swapped leads with Susan. P1 was a bit stiff and route finding was hard. Stayed close to the topo but ended about 10” short of anchors. Susan led the 4th class scramble which definitely felt 5th class. Accidentally missed anchors belaying on tree instead of anchors on the right wall. I led P3 which was easy but rope drag was significant. With double 60m ropes I was able to skip the hanging anchors and belay off small tree in the slot chimney. This saved time and was more comfortable. We got help placing a draw on the top of the 5.3 chimney and Susan lead the rest of the way to the terrace then built an anchor. It would be better to go right after the last chimney and used the bolted anchor. We were slow but super good experience and fun time.

2022-10-16,Cascading Crystal Kaleidoscope (CCK),5.8 PG13,"Link Led, Followed w/ Holly. Still my favorite climb so far at the gunks. P1 standard but one real move on shield. P2 we switched it up, instead of doing traditionally method of going up updraft corner, link lead first small (wet) corner about 15 ft to right, easy moves up to small ledge, shimmy to handholds and some burly moves up. Unfortunately had to take because couldn&#39;t get cam out after making move. Got it following go by unclipping it really low after move. Didn&#39;t link 2-3 to get some good photos. Such a great pitch, stay low as long as possible and step out over exposure after piton, until you hit first vertical crack, hard to remove cam meant I was stuck here until link rapped down to get it from above haha. Then to main vertical crack, use small LF on face, LH hand jam, RH on flake, to get good RF on flake. stand up and grab jug, only make one move on top thin rail then reach high and get jugs, traverse right and finish.

Roof was fine but took a long time finding feet hands which allowed span to jug. 10&#39; below p1 belay ledge is where I got in trouble. Hard to tell if chalked up thin vertical crack or right corner then traverse was correct method. Both are doable, linked took right but holly and I struggled on crack, might have been enduro, link says corner was all jugs. If doing thin crack, side pulls on left work your way up with RH on crack then large dynamic move to jug rail. Link said corner to jug rail traverse was easier. Start of P2, was fun long moves between jugs. Rest of it was easy but beautiful arete climbing of the nose of high E buttress. Fun but need to figure out end of P1.

P1 started with hard problem but stemming left side allowed me to send this section. Rest of pitch 1 was good hand jams
with awkward body position. I extremely tired but pushed through the cruxs with lots of rests on cams. Crux with wobbling chockstone stuck in crack system was crazy! P2 had OW boulder problem which I found perfect beta, knee into first foothold and drop foot against right side chimney for locked knee bar, work hands and LF without body weight then reach high. This was heady part for link, chimney and cracks very polished. P2/3 after OW was fun easy/moderate chimneys exit to the left then step over. 15 feet of face climbing where we meet up with our friends on the other side of the tower. Rapped off north side with a 70m (heady to get over edge), skipped first anchors to barely make it two second, then short rap to third, then to ground-ish. Down climb was bit sketch but okay, had some makeshift raps. walk out was lovely in nice drizzle. Amazing lead by Link and Jack.

2023-12-15,Interrogation,5.12c/d,"Started working on it today. Third time here, first time just did the tens on the right, second time was too cold and snowy. Today also hiked in the snow and ice to get here but it’s so warm on this wall. Link is projecting the 13c eastern promises, and I’m projecting this one for the winter. They might both be over our heads, many say this is a 13a since holds keep breaking off and it’s sandbagged to start. But… the hard part turned out to be a slab! Anyway the first section leads up to a roof. Moves are doable but physical and then getting over the roof and pulling up on a crimp are all very exhausting for me. After that I love this climb. Very interesting, slabby and vertical moves. A good foot, thinking it might be a pistol squat on the right leg but I can’t really do that and my knees have been hurting a little lately. So next time I want to do the beginning better and find some ideas for that crux slab part. There are some good possibilities a little to the left. But hard since the right foot is way out. I’m excited about this climb!! Even if I don’t lead it cleanly would be awesome to make some progress on this while we’re living in Boulder.

We were all a little tired, but woke up early, said bye to Link’s parents after having breakfast with them in their trailer. And then headed to the trail. Eric and I went ahead and tried to figure out what Link meant by “turn right after 500 yards”. Got a little nervous, tried calling Link, he finally showed up. Hike was sunny and beautiful, got to the base pretty fast. Started climbing, first part was a little tricky because I was using slopers instead of stemming. Eric did it very well. Then we ran into the trash dogs, maybe 2-3 pitches in. They tried passing us but changed their minds, was a little chaotic. But then we continued on ahead. My index finger was split and would’ve started bleeding so I was trying to climb with the other fingers. Next couple pitches were fun, lots of chimneys but you could avoid them, lots of options. Amazing cave after the 4th pitch. Link aka cave yeti led it and then Eric and I had a ton of fun going through it. One of the trash dogs (not litter kitten but the other one whose name I don’t remember was there with us). Then Link was leading to the end but ran out of rope, told us to just start climbing together. Right after we had talked about this scenario the night before at dinner and how it’s not super safe. But anyway it was easy climbing and we got to the top! Ended too fast. Hiked back down and then had beers and chatted with our friends by the van.

2023-11-25,Totally-Clipse,5.8,"First slab outside. Adam helped me with technique as I was on the wall. Learning to trust my feet as I smear. It was very interesting to think through how to move up the wall with basically no feet, especially at the crux. I think I only had to take/fell at the crux but did so many times.

2023-11-25,With a Little Help from My Friends,5.10a,First 10 climb but maybe won’t fully claim it as that since I had “a little help from my friend”. Kai gave me a generous belay at both cruxes…especially the first one after I tried it many times. I got the move down but couldn’t stand up on my left foot on the hand match without pushing myself off the wall. Time to practice those pistol squats. Proud of myself. Slab is fun…on top rope! Could have finished off the climb strong but Kai lifted me w/o asking. I had a fun time on this one. ,https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106046077/with-a-little-help-from-my-friends,1,West Virginia > The New River Gorge Region > New River Gorge Proper > Endless Wall > E) Kaymoor Slabs,2.7,-1,TR,,Sport,,80.0,2600.0
2023-11-24,Rat's Alley,5.7,First crack section. Weirdly and surprisingly loved it. I could see if I was climbing a longer crack how I would get into a really nice meditative groove with foot and hand jams. Off-width section was fun but still freaks me out. Hard! Did my first foot and hand jams and felt good doing it. Wore Adam’s crack gloves and tried to really stick my arm in the crack. Hands were a little small for some sections of it. Last big move was hard for me but I got it and felt good. More new styles and technique !

2023-11-05,Hawk,5.5,"First climb with Emily!!!
Super wet and slimy right at the crux. Took a nice lil spinning whip from the rope pulling me around the corner after cleaning a piece. Slightly spicy first two pitches for me, felt like a fun challenge and showed me that I was getting stronger. 

Headlamp died as I was starting the last pitch, had to do it with phone flashlight in shirt. Pitch black. Not fun. Thankfully it was super short. Made it to the top fine but then had to do the small down climb to the rap station in the pitch black too. Oof. Taylor at the top helped.
