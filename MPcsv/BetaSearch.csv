2024-10-18,High Exposure,5.6,"With Seb. Linked P1 and p2. Rope drag was okay. Last piece before the traverse was dumb. P3 was a bit intimidating to get out but so good once I committed. Rest of face was beautiful. Took it slow didnâ€™t get pumped. This was a goal for the fall, so really happy. Maria/Madam G next.

2023-09-15,High Exposure,5.6,"Susan led to celebrate her FPO. She crushed. I would definitely lead P1, traverse seems potentially sketchy if rope drag isn&#39;t well managed but super fun. Definitely a real move about midway up P1. P2 would go but still a pumpy for my fitness. Place #4, before roof. Maybe first placement after on side pull or first rail? But don&#39;t forget about that RH side pull and blind foot to clear the roof. P1 Anchor Sling boulder and backup, P2 tree anchor.
