Bolted anchors. 5.6.</p><p>Pitch 2: Stay right of the chimney (the chimney to the left of the anchors is the start of pitch 2 of The Big Horn.) Start on the face above the anchors. Climb up to a left-facing corner. There are a couple of little offwidth moves in this section. Stay right at the top of the chimney, stepping out of the alcove, then move left into the crack, climbing up to a ledge with loose rock and bolted anchors. 5.7.</p><p>Pitch 3: Climb up about 10 feet and look to your left, for a left-leaning, right-facing corner/ramp. Follow the fun, narrow ramp, continuing to traverse left, to a protection bolt. The pro is a little tricky before the bolt: nuts in not too obvious seams. Move a little left of the bolt, then go straight up to the thin right-facing corner and up right to a ledge with bolted anchors. 5.7+.</p><p>Pitch 4: Climb up and traverse right about 20-30 feet heading for black varnished face holds.

This pitch ends with a beautiful finger crack to a triangular stepping stool to reach the anchors. The last moves to the belay are the crux.

The climb is 9 pitches long and over 1200 feet in height. However, the start of Solar Slab is on a huge terrace 500 feet up, which has a few different multi-pitch approaches. Probably the most common ways to get to the base of Solar Slab are to climb <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105732251/johnny-vegas\">Johnny Vegas</a> (5.7, 4 pitches), or the <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105732227/solar-slab-gully\">Solar Slab Gully</a> (5.3, 5 pitches). An early start is highly recommended to beat the crowds, climb the 14 pitches, and make the lengthy descent. A headlamp is also a good idea.</p><p>Start from the Oak Creek Canyon parking area, and follow the obvious trail for 45 minutes to an hour. A prominent trail leads to an obvious gully to the right, the Solar Slab Gully. Climb this or Johnny Vegas to the terrace 500 feet up.</p><p>P1) Wander up the beautiful featured golden slab for quite a ways to the start of a nice hand crack. There is little pro in the slab, and the hardest move is gaining the crack system. Follow the crack system to a ledge with a fixed 2-bolt anchor. (5.5)</p><p>P2) From the ledge, follow the sandy chimney left and up to another ledge to belay at. This is probably the worst pitch of the climb. (5.5)</p><p>P3) Wander up unprotected but well featured rock for about 20 feet to a finger crack. Traverse right when obvious and follow a corner to a small belay ledge. (5.6)</p><p>P4) Climb a varnished left facing corner until possible to traverse right to a huge belay ledge with fixed anchors. (5.6)</p><p>P5) Climb the beautiful hand crack as long as desired, eventually sinking in a belay at the best spot possible. Some bolts are found near the crack on this pitch. This is a 3 star pitch. (5.5)</p><p>P6) Finish up this crack, stepping left eventually and belaying at the top of a pillar. I don\\'t recommend trying to link this pitch with P5. I don\\'t think that even a 60 meter rope is long enough. (5.4)</p><p>P7) Wander up and right protecting in various features to get to a low angle crack. Climb this crack up to an anchor. Don\\'t stop at this point, but remember where this anchor is if you are planning to rap the route. Instead, traverse right a bit, then go up and easy corner to the huge low angle terrace. (5.3)</p><p>P8) Scramble up to a black varnished dihedral and sink a belay. Depending on your comfort level, this pitch can be done unroped. (class 4)</p><p>P9) Climb the black dihedral until the angle kicks back and sink a belay. (5.5)</p><p>Descent: Rappelling down slab is recommended unless many parties are below you. There is a good chance of getting your rop caught, so it is recommended to saddle it while lowering. There is a way to walk off back but it is difficult and time consuming. The rappels also take a lot of time, but it is a fairly straight forward way of getting off the rock. Down climb to the right of the last pitch on easy slabs (3rd class) to get to a traverse around to the belay ledge used below the dihedral. Then downclimb the 8th pitch and the last easy part of pitch 7 until the anchors mentioned. From here, rap (double ropes, 200\\' better, maybe even necessary?). Probably about 6 rappels gets you to the starting terrace. Then rap either Johnny Vegas or Solar Slab Gully (another 5 rappels).

In the Gunks, this means that it\\'s a 5.4 that\\'s particularly gripping.  Probably a tough lead for a 5.4 climber so I\\'ve called it 5.5. <br />  <br /> P1: Start one of two ways: up the corner about 8 feet to an undercling right (5.6) or up flakes about 10\\' right of the corner (see beta photo).  Both lead to a good ledge about 25\\' up.  Then up the corner (steep!) to an overhang - swing left on jugs and pull onto a small ledge with an anchor (ancient fixed pins that you should back up).  Belay here or continue up to the GT.  Be careful with runners if you want to go all the way to the GT. <br />  <br /> P2: Step left and climb up horizontals to an easy flake.  Then head up to a fixed pin, aiming right for a crack system that leads to the GT.  This part is very nice exposed 5.4 face climbing. <br />  <br /> P3: At the GT, step off a big block to the face just left of the huge roof.

In the Gunks, this means that it\\'s a 5.4 that\\'s particularly gripping.  Probably a tough lead for a 5.4 climber so I\\'ve called it 5.5. <br />  <br /> P1: Start one of two ways: up the corner about 8 feet to an undercling right (5.6) or up flakes about 10\\' right of the corner (see beta photo).  Both lead to a good ledge about 25\\' up.  Then up the corner (steep!) to an overhang - swing left on jugs and pull onto a small ledge with an anchor (ancient fixed pins that you should back up).  Belay here or continue up to the GT.  Be careful with runners if you want to go all the way to the GT. <br />  <br /> P2: Step left and climb up horizontals to an easy flake.  Then head up to a fixed pin, aiming right for a crack system that leads to the GT.  This part is very nice exposed 5.4 face climbing. <br />  <br /> P3: At the GT, step off a big block to the face just left of the huge roof.  Climb about 20\\' up and then work right (crux) below one roof and above the other.  Spectacular!

The second pitch however, was a old top rope variation of orangutan rated 5.9+. \"</div><br /><img alt=\"First Pitch instagram.com/radam_gnawrot\" class=\"\" src=\"https://mountainproject.com/assets/photos/climb/112476926_smallMed_1494307367.jpg?cache=1702072272\" /><br /><a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105913279/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>\\n        \\n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/109478733/southeastern-lowlands\">Southeastern Lo&hellip;</a>\\n        \\n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/106133953/ralph-stover-state-park-high-rocks\">Ralph Stover SP&hellip;</a>\\n        \\n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/107226640/orangutan-buttress\">i.

Continue up the steep headwall and surmount a little roof at the top (crux). If you have a #3 and #4 Camalot, you can belay just above the roof (and watch/coach your second at the crux roof), otherwise continue up an easy gully and belay from a spike of rock at the top.<br /><br />c.

Climb the corner, then continue up and right on easy ramps to a belay stance below or just right of a chimney.<br /><br />P5. Several options here:<br /><br />a. Easy finish: 5.4, 60\\'. Climb the chimney to the top.<br /><br />b. Fun finish: 5.8, 80\\'. Climb up a ramp right of the chimney to a huge corner with a wide crack. Climb up the face left of the corner to a fixed pin. Continue up the steep headwall and surmount a little roof at the top (crux). If you have a #3 and #4 Camalot, you can belay just above the roof (and watch/coach your second at the crux roof), otherwise continue up an easy gully and belay from a spike of rock at the top.<br /><br />c. Grovel finish: 5.7, 80\\'. Climb the wide crack in the corner just right of the previous variation.<br /><br />To descend: follow deep grooves to the south until you reach a dirt trail. Go 30\\' right (west) and then follow the marked Bastille descent trail north and down to the road at the base of the cliff.<br /><br />(Ed. Note: beginner leaders--make sure you\\'re solid on crack techique before trying this one. Placing gear is not trivial for the inexperienced.)</div><br /><img alt=\"The Bastille Crack, route traced....\" class=\"\" src=\"https://mountainproject.com/assets/photos/climb/118681104_smallMed_1584847971.jpg?cache=1727899148\" /><br /><a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105708956/colorado\">Colorado</a>\\n        \\n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105801420/boulder\">Boulder</a>\\n        \\n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105744246/eldorado-canyon-state-park\">Eldorado Canyon SP</a>\\n        \\n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105807521/the-bastille\">Bastille</a>\\n        \\n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105744723/the-bastille-n-face\">Bastille - N Face</a>'}}, {'title': 'Tick: Ruper (5.8+)', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.mountainproject.com/rss/user-ticks/200907207', 'value': 'Tick: Ruper (5.8+)'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105748774/ruper'}], 'link': 'https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105748774/ruper', 'id': 'MPObject_126912306', 'guidislink': False, 'published': 'Mon, 16 Sep 2024 15:15:36 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=9, tm_mday=16, tm_hour=15, tm_min=15, tm_sec=36, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=260, tm_isdst=0), 'summary': '<div class=\"fr-view\">This is my favorite 5.8 route in the canyon.

The climb is 9 pitches long and over 1200 feet in height. However, the start of Solar Slab is on a huge terrace 500 feet up, which has a few different multi-pitch approaches. Probably the most common ways to get to the base of Solar Slab are to climb <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105732251/johnny-vegas\">Johnny Vegas</a> (5.7, 4 pitches), or the <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105732227/solar-slab-gully\">Solar Slab Gully</a> (5.3, 5 pitches). An early start is highly recommended to beat the crowds, climb the 14 pitches, and make the lengthy descent. A headlamp is also a good idea.</p><p>Start from the Oak Creek Canyon parking area, and follow the obvious trail for 45 minutes to an hour. A prominent trail leads to an obvious gully to the right, the Solar Slab Gully. Climb this or Johnny Vegas to the terrace 500 feet up.</p><p>P1) Wander up the beautiful featured golden slab for quite a ways to the start of a nice hand crack. There is little pro in the slab, and the hardest move is gaining the crack system. Follow the crack system to a ledge with a fixed 2-bolt anchor. (5.5)</p><p>P2) From the ledge, follow the sandy chimney left and up to another ledge to belay at. This is probably the worst pitch of the climb. (5.5)</p><p>P3) Wander up unprotected but well featured rock for about 20 feet to a finger crack. Traverse right when obvious and follow a corner to a small belay ledge. (5.6)</p><p>P4) Climb a varnished left facing corner until possible to traverse right to a huge belay ledge with fixed anchors. (5.6)</p><p>P5) Climb the beautiful hand crack as long as desired, eventually sinking in a belay at the best spot possible. Some bolts are found near the crack on this pitch. This is a 3 star pitch. (5.5)</p><p>P6) Finish up this crack, stepping left eventually and belaying at the top of a pillar. I don\\'t recommend trying to link this pitch with P5. I don\\'t think that even a 60 meter rope is long enough. (5.4)</p><p>P7) Wander up and right protecting in various features to get to a low angle crack. Climb this crack up to an anchor. Don\\'t stop at this point, but remember where this anchor is if you are planning to rap the route. Instead, traverse right a bit, then go up and easy corner to the huge low angle terrace. (5.3)</p><p>P8) Scramble up to a black varnished dihedral and sink a belay. Depending on your comfort level, this pitch can be done unroped. (class 4)</p><p>P9) Climb the black dihedral until the angle kicks back and sink a belay. (5.5)</p><p>Descent: Rappelling down slab is recommended unless many parties are below you. There is a good chance of getting your rop caught, so it is recommended to saddle it while lowering. There is a way to walk off back but it is difficult and time consuming. The rappels also take a lot of time, but it is a fairly straight forward way of getting off the rock. Down climb to the right of the last pitch on easy slabs (3rd class) to get to a traverse around to the belay ledge used below the dihedral. Then downclimb the 8th pitch and the last easy part of pitch 7 until the anchors mentioned. From here, rap (double ropes, 200\\' better, maybe even necessary?).

The climb is 9 pitches long and over 1200 feet in height. However, the start of Solar Slab is on a huge terrace 500 feet up, which has a few different multi-pitch approaches. Probably the most common ways to get to the base of Solar Slab are to climb <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105732251/johnny-vegas\">Johnny Vegas</a> (5.7, 4 pitches), or the <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105732227/solar-slab-gully\">Solar Slab Gully</a> (5.3, 5 pitches). An early start is highly recommended to beat the crowds, climb the 14 pitches, and make the lengthy descent. A headlamp is also a good idea.</p><p>Start from the Oak Creek Canyon parking area, and follow the obvious trail for 45 minutes to an hour. A prominent trail leads to an obvious gully to the right, the Solar Slab Gully. Climb this or Johnny Vegas to the terrace 500 feet up.</p><p>P1) Wander up the beautiful featured golden slab for quite a ways to the start of a nice hand crack. There is little pro in the slab, and the hardest move is gaining the crack system. Follow the crack system to a ledge with a fixed 2-bolt anchor. (5.5)</p><p>P2) From the ledge, follow the sandy chimney left and up to another ledge to belay at. This is probably the worst pitch of the climb. (5.5)</p><p>P3) Wander up unprotected but well featured rock for about 20 feet to a finger crack. Traverse right when obvious and follow a corner to a small belay ledge. (5.6)</p><p>P4) Climb a varnished left facing corner until possible to traverse right to a huge belay ledge with fixed anchors. (5.6)</p><p>P5) Climb the beautiful hand crack as long as desired, eventually sinking in a belay at the best spot possible. Some bolts are found near the crack on this pitch. This is a 3 star pitch. (5.5)</p><p>P6) Finish up this crack, stepping left eventually and belaying at the top of a pillar. I don\\'t recommend trying to link this pitch with P5. I don\\'t think that even a 60 meter rope is long enough. (5.4)</p><p>P7) Wander up and right protecting in various features to get to a low angle crack. Climb this crack up to an anchor. Don\\'t stop at this point, but remember where this anchor is if you are planning to rap the route. Instead, traverse right a bit, then go up and easy corner to the huge low angle terrace. (5.3)</p><p>P8) Scramble up to a black varnished dihedral and sink a belay. Depending on your comfort level, this pitch can be done unroped. (class 4)</p><p>P9) Climb the black dihedral until the angle kicks back and sink a belay. (5.5)</p><p>Descent: Rappelling down slab is recommended unless many parties are below you. There is a good chance of getting your rop caught, so it is recommended to saddle it while lowering. There is a way to walk off back but it is difficult and time consuming. The rappels also take a lot of time, but it is a fairly straight forward way of getting off the rock. Down climb to the right of the last pitch on easy slabs (3rd class) to get to a traverse around to the belay ledge used below the dihedral. Then downclimb the 8th pitch and the last easy part of pitch 7 until the anchors mentioned. From here, rap (double ropes, 200\\' better, maybe even necessary?). Probably about 6 rappels gets you to the starting terrace. Then rap either Johnny Vegas or Solar Slab Gully (another 5 rappels). I recommend the gully, as Johnny Vegas is likely to get your rope stuck.</p><p>There is an entire chapter about this route in <a href=\"http://www.verexpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Red Rock Odyssey</a></p></div><br /><img alt=\"Joe Herbst on the first ascent of Solar Slab, January 1975.\" class=\"\" src=\"https://mountainproject.com/assets/photos/climb/5200011_smallMed_1557853697.jpg?cache=1704160040\" /><br /><a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105708961/nevada\">Nevada</a>\\n        \\n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/113755154/southern-nevada\">Southern Nevada</a>\\n        \\n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105731932/red-rocks\">Red Rocks</a>\\n        \\n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105731965/oak-creek-canyon\">(12) Oak Creek&hellip;</a>\\n        \\n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105732007/solar-slab-upper-tier\">Solar Slab - Upper Tier</a>'}}], 'feed': {'title': 'Ticks for Eric Blow on Mountain Project', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.mountainproject.com/rss/user-ticks/200907207', 'value': 'Ticks for Eric Blow on Mountain Project'}, 'subtitle': 'The Definitive Climbing Resource', 'subtitle_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.mountainproject.com/rss/user-ticks/200907207', 'value': 'The Definitive Climbing Resource'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.mountainproject.com'}], 'link': 'https://www.mountainproject.com', 'language': 'en-us', 'updated': 'Tue, 14 Jan 2025 19:17:46 +0000', 'updated_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=14, tm_hour=19, tm_min=17, tm_sec=46, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=14, tm_isdst=0)}, 'headers': {'date': 'Tue, 14 Jan 2025 19:17:46 GMT', 'server': 'Apache', 'x-frame-options': 'SAMEORIGIN', 'cache-control': 'max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-cache, no-store, private, max-age=2592000', 'pragma': 'no-cache', 'x-ap-request-id': '7304ac09-f4d6-4bc4-b9ab-bcfc10213606', 'set-cookie': 'GCLB=CLyr8ZbF8orVUBAD; path=/; HttpOnly', 'expires': 'Thu, 13 Feb 2025 19:17:46 GMT', 'vary': 'Accept-Encoding', 'content-encoding': 'gzip', 'content-type': 'Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8', 'via': '1.1 google', 'strict-transport-security': 'max-age=31536000', 'alt-svc': 'h3=\":443\"; ma=2592000,h3-29=\":443\"; ma=2592000', 'connection': 'close', 'transfer-encoding': 'chunked'}, 'href': 'https://www.mountainproject.com/rss/user-ticks/200907207', 'status': 200, 'encoding': 'utf-8', 'bozo_exception': NonXMLContentType('Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 is not an XML media type'), 'version': 'rss20', 'namespaces': {'geo': 'http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#', 'dc': 'http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/', 'content': 'http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/'}}\n",
