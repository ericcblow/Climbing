Definitely a real move about midway up P1. P2 would go but still a pumpy for my fitness. Place #4, before roof. Maybe first placement after on side pull or first rail? But don&#39;t forget about that RH side pull and blind foot to clear the roof. P1 Anchor Sling boulder and backup, P2 tree anchor.  \n",
