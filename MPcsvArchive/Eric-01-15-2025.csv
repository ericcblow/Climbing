Very satisfying, then some dihedreal climbing with small R feet into an overhang. Some sections really had little pro and small crack hands, where pulling on a couple fingers was the best you got. Great belay from L who was talking to O on the radio the whole time haha. L lead P23, which had 15 ft of burly climbing on a good hand crack but honestly felt a bit sweaty this day.

The rest of the climb doesn&#39;t have anything as glassy as that first foot transitioning from R to L flake. I linked P1/2; I took it really slow but it was very enjoyable and challenging. I did not stem the right and left flake but jammed the RF and had the LF on the face. I would have appreciated having my large set of nuts, the anchor at the top of P2 took .5-1 cams. Link lead P34, I think P3 was as challenging as P1 and would have required some effort but P4 was chill and would love to lead that next time. I led P5 and built an anchor on top out of . 4-.75 size.

Oak and I started same time, he tagged the line and I tied in once he made to top, to speed up the process. First three moves of P1 might have been crux, less than ideal finger crack to a jug. Also found the layback crack hard, took at the top. Feet are smears most of the time. Loved P3 traverse with the downclimb to the jug and then the step through. Down climbed to second half on belay but was okay. Linked P4/5 in a really enjoyable dihedral. P6 was rotten band, be careful with choss.

Ended up using small RF under the roof to wedge myself inside in order to place gear and rest but didn’t love how small and polished that RF was. Felt great to get through. The roof was also really fun, placed #3 right before then checked out holds before resting and then going for it. One of my best lead trad experiences so far. Sara and Lucia both crushed the pitch and enjoyed the challenge of the roof. Sara expertly deployed some beach whaling techniques that I think she learned from me. We went on for p2 even though the sun was setting and we had one headlamp between the three of us but it’s too nice of a pitch to skip.

Corner was still pretty stressful and but got up it slowly. Traverse felt fun and easy. Sara didn’t like the traverse much because of rope twisting plus exposure. I had to build hanging trad anchor and pitch it out because of rope drag but with one follower. Doing it in one pitch would be doable, more fun, and much more time efficient.

Doing this in a triple would be enjoyable and would make the rappel faster. Sara loved it and got a bit higher in the traverse probably because I was keeping her to tight and it was forcing that direction. She should try it again keeping feet low.

Problem is most people do a 30m run out on the slab to put a first piece of gear in the roof crack. We got some help from a party of Canadian simul climbers so didn’t have to place it. I think it’s very doable but when I led it. After reaching the first flake on the slab, I would place pro there. Traverse to the crack place pro there and then down climber to remove the flake pro. We learned there is bolted anchors at each pitch and rappelling each pitch is possible. So next time let’s go for a new high point.

I led P3 which was easy but rope drag was significant. With double 60m ropes I was able to skip the hanging anchors and belay off small tree in the slot chimney. This saved time and was more comfortable. We got help placing a draw on the top of the 5.3 chimney and Susan lead the rest of the way to the terrace then built an anchor.

2022-10-16,"Cascading Crystal Kaleidoscope (CCK)","5.8 PG13","Link Led, Followed w/ Holly. Still my favorite climb so far at the gunks. P1 standard but one real move on shield. P2 we switched it up, instead of doing traditionally method of going up updraft corner, link lead first small (wet) corner about 15 ft to right, easy moves up to small ledge, shimmy to handholds and some burly moves up. Unfortunately had to take because couldn&#39;t get cam out after making move. Got it following go by unclipping it really low after move. Didn&#39;t link 2-3 to get some good photos. Such a great pitch, stay low as long as possible and step out over exposure after piton, until you hit first vertical crack, hard to remove cam meant I was stuck here until link rapped down to get it from above haha. Then to main vertical crack, use small LF on face, LH hand jam, RH on flake, to get good RF on flake. stand up and grab jug, only make one move on top thin rail then reach high and get jugs, traverse right and finish.

Roof was fine but took a long time finding feet hands which allowed span to jug. 10&#39; below p1 belay ledge is where I got in trouble. Hard to tell if chalked up thin vertical crack or right corner then traverse was correct method. Both are doable, linked took right but holly and I struggled on crack, might have been enduro, link says corner was all jugs. If doing thin crack, side pulls on left work your way up with RH on crack then large dynamic move to jug rail. Link said corner to jug rail traverse was easier.

with awkward body position. I extremely tired but pushed through the cruxs with lots of rests on cams. Crux with wobbling chockstone stuck in crack system was crazy! P2 had OW boulder problem which I found perfect beta, knee into first foothold and drop foot against right side chimney for locked knee bar, work hands and LF without body weight then reach high. This was heady part for link, chimney and cracks very polished. P2/3 after OW was fun easy/moderate chimneys exit to the left then step over. 15 feet of face climbing where we meet up with our friends on the other side of the tower. Rapped off north side with a 70m (heady to get over edge), skipped first anchors to barely make it two second, then short rap to third, then to ground-ish.
