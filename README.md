# Climbing
A repo to play around with Mountain Project climbing data

Goal: 
  - Have my friends been crushing?
    - Download ticks and check against entered date - Done 
    - RSS feed? 
  - Use CSV data to do some fun analysis and visualization of climbing 
  - Has a friend climbed this route prompt? Cross reference friends list for specific tick to know who to ask for beta
    
After developed, I'll make generic version for general public.
