# Climbing 	
A repo to play around with Mountain Project climbing data :mountain:

Current Functionality:
  1. Have my friends been crushing? :muscle:
      - Set a specific data and returns information about friends climbing activities (Routes, Pitches, Days Out)
      - Notebook Name: AreMyFriendsCrushing.ipynb 

  2. Has a friend climbed this route prompt? :monocle_face:
       - Cross reference friends list for specific tick to know who to ask for beta
       - Notebook Name: BetaFromAFriend.ipynb

         
  3. Does your friend write really long ticks (me)? :nerd_face: :books:
      - Generate some statistic about particularly wordy or laconic friends
      - See friends longest ticks and get an glimpse into their biggest epic
      - Notebook Name: TicksArePersonalDiaries.ipynb
  
  4. Want to generate a tick summary of a recent trip? :turkey:
      - Enter who was there over what dates and this notebook returns information about who climbed what
      - As well as some stats for the friend group
      - Notebook Name: ThxGivingAtThe
  

  
To add: 
  1. Use CSV data to do some fun analysis and visualization of climbing 
  2. Are my friends climbing nearby? 
      - Set a date and location to filter for nearby friends?
  3. How am I progressing?
      - See your grade over time? filter for sport, trad, ice...
  4. Scrap routes data?
      - Check for rating variance 
      - Do historically strong climbers fall/hung? 
            - Sandbag or Featherweight tag 
  
After developed, I'll make generic version for easier public use but in the meantime feel free to fork.
