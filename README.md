# Climbing 	
A repo to play around with Mountain Project climbing data :mountain:

Current Functionality: 
  1. Have my friends been crushing?
    - Set a specific data and returns information about friends climbing activities (Routes, Pitches, Days Out)
      - Notebook Name: AreMyFriendsCrushing.ipynb
  3. Has a friend climbed this route prompt? 
    - Cross reference friends list for specific tick to know who to ask for beta
       - Notebook Name: BetaFromAFriend.ipynb
  5. Does your friend write really long ticks (me)?
    - Generate some statistic about particularly wordy or laconic friends
    - See friends longest ticks and get an glimpse into their biggest epic
       - Notebook Name: TicksArePersonalDiaries.ipynb
  
  
To add: 
  1. Use CSV data to do some fun analysis and visualization of climbing 
  2. Duplicate and tweak AreMyFriendsCrushing to ThxGivingAtThe which enables a start and stop date and then generates trip report of climbs
  3. 
After developed, I'll make generic version for easier public use but in the meantime feel free to fork.
