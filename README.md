# Climbing
A repo to play around with Mountain Project climbing data

Current Functionality: 
  1. Have my friends been crushing?
    - Set a specific data and returns information about friends climbing activities (Routes, Pitches, Days Out)
  2. Has a friend climbed this route prompt? 
    - Cross reference friends list for specific tick to know who to ask for beta
  
  
To add:   
    1. Use CSV data to do some fun analysis and visualization of climbing 
    2. Does your friend write really long ticks (me)?
    - Generate some statistic about particularly wordy or laconic friends. 

After developed, I'll make generic version for general public.
