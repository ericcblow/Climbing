# Climbing
A repo to play around with Mountain Project climbing data

<<<<<<< HEAD
Current Functionality: 
  1. Have my friends been crushing?
    - Set a specific data and returns information about friends climbing activities (Routes, Pitches, Days Out)
  2. Has a friend climbed this route prompt? 
    - Cross reference friends list for specific tick to know who to ask for beta
  
  
To add:   
    1. Use CSV data to do some fun analysis and visualization of climbing 
    2. Does your friend write really long ticks (me)?
    - Generate some statistic about particularly wordy or laconic friends. 
=======
Goal: 
  - Have my friends been crushing?
    - Download ticks and check against entered date - Done 
    - RSS feed? 
  - Use CSV data to do some fun analysis and visualization of climbing 
  - Has a friend climbed this route prompt? Cross reference friends list for specific tick to know who to ask for beta - Done
