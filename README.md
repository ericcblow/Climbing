# Climbing
A repo to play around with Mountain Project climbing data

Goal: 
  - Use RSS feed to check if friends have recently climbed and if so generate report about what friends have recently climbed
   - Use CSV data to do some fun analysis and visualization of climbing 
   - Has a friend climbed this route prompt? Cross reference friends list for specific tick
