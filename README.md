# Climbing
A repo to play around with Mountain Project climbing data

Goal: 
  - Use RSS feed to check if friends have recently climbed and if so generate report about they're crushing
  - Use CSV data to do some fun analysis and visualization of climbing 
  - Has a friend climbed this route prompt? Cross reference friends list for specific tick to know who to ask for beta
    
After developed, I'll make generic version for general public.
