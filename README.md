# Climbing 	
A repo to play around with Mountain Project climbing data :mountain:

Current Functionality: 
  1. Have my friends been crushing?
    - Set a specific data and returns information about friends climbing activities (Routes, Pitches, Days Out)
  2. Has a friend climbed this route prompt? 
    - Cross reference friends list for specific tick to know who to ask for beta
  3. Does your friend write really long ticks (me)?
    - Generate some statistic about particularly wordy or laconic friends
    - See friends longest ticks and get an glimpse into their biggest epic 
  
  
To add: 
  1. Use CSV data to do some fun analysis and visualization of climbing 

After developed, I'll make generic version for general public.
